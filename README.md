# Kafka-mongodb-pyspark
This repository is used for adding pyspark analysis on the mongodb collection


I had used 3 csv files to load from local to MongoDB using Confluent Kafka.


Producer takes the 3 csv files and loads them into their respective Kafka Topics.

I had used individual consumers for each of the csv files which I had used.

For the Pyspark analysis part used pyspark lab for analysis.
